# what is this

A SPA (Single Page Application) router for react made with simple hooks

## Why another router

In the company i work in, we had a project made with react and we used react-router

It worked well for us, but we had some contraints on it, and i found myself fighting a lot with it, to
make it do what i wanted.

At some point the development of react-router went stale and Ryan Florence, one of the creators of react-router, made a new router
called @reach/router and i start using it for the new project i was working with

Then Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson started woking together and they started a new version of react-router
That means that @reach/router would be deprecated.

And for some time we stayed in a limbo in the router space.

By that time react had released it's new version which included hooks and i was pretty excited with it
A lot of code started poping out using the new API's and some experiments where done on the router space

So i picked up some of those experiments and adapted to what i needed as an experimental side project.

Ended up using it on our project, and it's been great for us.

I've lost less time maintaining that than i spended before workarrounding react-router

So i decided to share this experiment on public GitHub, i hope to improve the samples,
include the tests i have on our internal repo and publish on Npm at some point

Hope this helps someone
